description: In this 1911 publication, Rose provides a detailed history of the Anglo-French
  wars that started in 1791. The text remained the standard work on the subject for
  close to sixty years. In the book, Rose carefully sets forth the disputes with France,
  the main episodes of the War, and the resulting political consequences. Still an
  authoritative resource, William Pitt and the Great War is a balanced treatment of
  this dramatic period in European history.
